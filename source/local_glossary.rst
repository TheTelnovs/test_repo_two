   Mind Map
      A visualization technic to come up with ideas, topics 
      or other mental lists. It is supposed to facilitate 
      creative thinking and reveal "writers block".

      team spirit as is acknoledged to be usefull with teams. 

      In behavioral geography, a mental map 
      is a person's point-of-view perception 
      of their area of interaction. 
      Although this kind of subject matter would seem most likely 
      to be studied by fields in the social sciences, 
      this particular subject is most often studied by modern-day geographers.

   MRI
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      Magnetic resonance imaging is a medical imaging technique 
      used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy 
      and the physiological processes of the body. 

      It demonstrates very small differences of contrast 
      between different tissues. MRT uses information of 
      hydrogen nuclei (protons) which are exitated (and responding) 
      by a high frequency radio wave pulse in the presence of 
      a very strong magnetic field. 
      MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, 
      and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body.
