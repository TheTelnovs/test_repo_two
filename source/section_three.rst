Functional MRT
======================

Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) 
measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. 
This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow 
and neuronal activation are coupled. 
When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases.
