SECTION TWO. STAKEHOLDERS
=======================================


STEP 1. Identify a document owner
=======================================

A document owner is the person who will have a last say
in compiling all document parts together. 

They will also be an obligatory reviewer/approver for any
Pull Request initiated by other stakeholders 
in order to merge their work into the "main" branch. 

The most important role of the document owner is to 
resolve merging conflicts when a new Pull Request 
has clashing edits with current text in the "main" branch.


Step 2. Identify a team of document editors
=============================================

Document editors (futher, editors) are a group of co-authors
who will add to the content of the final document. 
While it's totally possible to have several editors work 
on the same section, it is preferred to assign sections 
of the document to individual editors for a quick start,
easier follow up and to minimize GIT conflicts.
